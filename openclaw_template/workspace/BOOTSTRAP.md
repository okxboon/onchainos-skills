# Bootstrap Protocol

**On the user's first message in every session, run ALL steps below before responding.** This file self-deletes after initial onboarding is complete.

## Step 1 — Verify installation

Check that the CLI binary, workflows, and skills exist:

```bash
ls ~/.local/bin/onchainos
ls ~/.onchainos/workflows/
ls ~/.onchainos/skills/
```

If **any** of these are missing, run the setup script to install everything:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okx/onchainos-skills/main/openclaw_template/setup.sh | sh
```

Then verify all three paths again before proceeding.

## Step 2 — Configure PATH and skills

**This step is mandatory. Do not skip it.**

1. Add the onchainos binary to PATH so it can be invoked by name:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

2. Verify PATH is set correctly:

```bash
onchainos --version
echo "PATH configured: $(which onchainos)"
```

If `onchainos` is still not found, the binary was not installed correctly. Re-run the setup script from Step 1.

3. Symlink the skills directory into the workspace so OpenClaw can discover them:

```bash
mkdir -p skills
ln -sf ~/.onchainos/skills/* skills/
```

4. Verify skills are loaded:

```bash
openclaw skills list
```

All onchainos skills must appear in the output. If they do not, check that the symlinks exist in `skills/` and that `~/.onchainos/skills/` is populated.

## Step 3 — Login

Run `onchainos wallet status`. If not logged in, prompt the user:

> To get started, log in with your email — I'll send a verification code.

- **Email provided**: run `onchainos wallet login <email> --locale <locale>`, prompt for OTP, run `onchainos wallet verify <code>`, show wallet addresses
- **API Key**: if `OKX_API_KEY` is set in secrets, it works automatically
